## Fem(inist) Manifestos

Confronted with so many choices of readings I decided to focus on gender-relevant manifestos (I use this phrase since they don't all explicitly say feminist). I was curious to see if there were any trends or changes over time, and I also recently ready a kind of TERFy interview about xenofeminism and was curious about the manifesto itself. So I investigated all or in part of:

 Cyborg Manifesto (1984) <br>
 Cyberfeminist Manifesto for the 21st Century (1991) <br>
 A Feminist Server Manifesto (2013) <br>
 The Cybertwee Manifesto (2014) <br>
 Xenofeminist Manifesto (2015)

As with probably any manifesto, the immediate connecting thread is that they are all "againts" a current status-quo, in this case around women, femininity, and gendered labor. The Cyborg Manifesto and Xenofeminist Manifesto make for interesting bookends in that both explicitly engage with historical discourses around the construction of "women" and seek to destabilize and unsettle that normalization. Haraway in particular is responding to the radical feminist notion of the time that there is some essential pre-patriarchy "starting point" women could get back to, rather than a total reimagining going forward. (1) These are also the longest manifestos, which allows for nuance and fleshing out of ideas, but means they lack the punch and spirit of some of the shorter ones.

In contrast the Cyberfeminist Manifesto siezes on the othering of the bodily construction of women by repeating words like "cunt"
 and "clitoris." "We see art with our cunt we make art with our cunt" is in direct opposition to phallocentric, male-gaze-y histories, and a refeusal to accept the normal shame around being called or having a "cunt." Because of this though it does feel a little reactionary and content with revenge rather than say revolution. Not that that has to be a problem, but like feminisms that focus on misandry rather than the bigger tangle of oppressions, I find they'll only get your analysis so far.

I like the way A Feminist Server Manifesto and The Cybertwee Manifesto focus on ways of being in the world. More aligned with the Cyborg than the Cyberfeminist, they situate themselves acknowledging traits that have been pushed on women and then been devalued because of that association, but aren't necessarily looking to keep those traits as a static grouped category.  The goals seem to be not just to uplift the category of women but to reintegrate "feminine" knowledge into discourses as a whole. Alone this tactic can also have its problems--we can't toss out cis womanhood as a material site of oppression--but I think given the popularity of notions like "lean in" which esentially say women need to be meaner and more "masculine", or ideas about men needing to be stoic and not responsible for emotional processing, statements championing feminine behavior itself are worthwhile. Turning feminine behavior specifically towards technology plays with whatever unconcious assumptions we may have about servers or the internet, and denaturalizes the forms those spaces have taken in a playful way. Something about their brevity also suits them, there's no pompous verbosity.

So while these manifestos do present a wide range of feminisms, it's not a range of change in a particular direction. Feminism as an umbella is still very much a cacophony of different opinions, and these are interesting artifacts of that.
